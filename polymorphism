Bread Butter Jam Fuji likes bread so much. She eats bread daily. She eats bread with butter and jam or sometimes jam alone. Rarely she eats bread alone. 
But she wants to know which gives her more energy. So she want to calculate how much energy she gains from the bread that she eats. Help her in finding the amount of
energy gained from given calories. 1 kcal = 4.1868 kJ Bread = 74 calories Butter = 102 calories Jam = 26 calories Write a program to calculate the energy and implement
it using Method overloading concept. Print energy with three decimal places. Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having 
same name, but their arguments type or the return type of the method or the number of arguments are different. Create two class namely, Main and Calories. Get all 
details in Main class. Include a method called,calculateCalories() which is overloaded three times. First calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats
only bread. Second calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats bread and jam. Third calculateCalories() is to calculate the calorie when she eats 
bread, butter and Jam. Include a method called returnCalories() that returns the calculated calories. Include a method called calculateEnergy() that calculates the 
energy and returns the energy value.
